Graph Data Structure : Since its not a linear DS, it gets a lil more complex.
        There are 3 ways to represent a graph
            1. Adjacency Matrix

                Let's gather the information we need to store for a Graph G.
                    The number of vertices
                    The number of edges
                    Which edge connects which two Nodes :
                        For this lets take a 2D Array
                        In which the 1,0 is stored that shows whether there is an edge betweeen two nodes.


* Graphs are abstract Data Type {ADT : Made up of primitive data types arranged in some way in memory (This is called Data structures) which allows various operations on it, which makes it Abstract Data Type} which implements the concept of Graphs from Mathematics.

A Graph is simply a collection of nodes connected by edges, This is not a linear Data structure hence its implementation is quite different.

ADT = DS + Operation

    Non Linear Data Structures
    Used to model a lot of real work systems and application
    
* A graph is like a tree where each node is connected to other nodes but a Tree follows some set of rules dictating the connection among nodes in a Tree.

    - If there are N Nodes, there must be exactly N-1 edges
    
    - All Nodes must be reachable, and from Root to a node there should be only one unique Path.
    
    - Tree is only a special kind of Graph.

    - Study of Graph is called Graph Theory
    
        A graph G is an ordered pair of set toalNumberOfVertices of vertices and a set E of edges.
        
            G = (toalNumberOfVertices, E)
            
            Ordered pair (a,b) != (b,a) {if a != b}
            
            Oredered pair is written as (a, b, c, d)
            Unoredered pair is written as {a, b, c, d}
            
* Vertices :

    toalNumberOfVertices = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} Set of verticies of a Graph

* Edges

    - Directed Edge

        (u, v) Goes from u -> b
        (v, u) Goes from v -> u
        
            {The above is an example of parallel edges between two nodes}
            
            Digraphs is graph having directed edges / Ordered Pairs
    
    - Undirected Edge
    
        Undirected Edge makes a two way connection, Unoredred pairs 
        
        Edges = {
            {v1, v2}, {v2, v3}, {v3,v5}, {v6, v7}
        }
        
# We will focus on Graphs which just have directed or just Undirected edges, not mixed of 2.

# Examples Of Graphs :

        # Social Netowrk (Unweighted, Undirected Graph)

            -> Like Facebook is an undirected Graph, you have a friend, he has a friend too. Its MUTUAL, hence undirected.
            -> Suggesting Friends,
                Suggesting Friends of Friends
            -> Counting the number of Mutual Friends

        # Internet Web Pages Links (Unweighted, Directed Graph)
            
            -> You have directed links from one page to another, mutual links is not necessary.
            -> You link wikepedia doesnt mean Wikepedia will also link you too.
            -> This is a directed edge situation.
            -> Web Crawling is Graph Traversal, Traversing all nodes of a graph from one node. We have various Graph Traversal algorithms.
            
        # Maps of Highway / Cities
            -> Set of cities connected by rail route.
            -> Intercity Road Network  (Weighted, Undirected Graph)
            
                - You have to assign weights to the connecting edges so as to show the real world distance in the Graph.
                - So as to find the minimum distances between two nodes / cities, you would be required to traverse the path where the cost of reaching the other node is minimum, which help us finding the best possible path between source and destination.
            
            -> Intracity Maps, (Weighted, Directed Graphs) 
                * As there are many One ways too existing in the cities.
                
        # Connection between Routers on Internet can be maintained by Graph. 
        Graph Implements the Mathematical Definition of Graph.

# Graph Properties 

    toalNumberOfVertices = {v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 ...}
    E = {e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6 ...}
    Hence, G = (toalNumberOfVertices, E) or (E, toalNumberOfVertices)

    |toalNumberOfVertices| - Number of vertices
    |E| - Number of edges

    - Edges can be directed / undirected
    - Edges can have weights i.e. weighted graphs
    
    - Edge has self loop if you have only one Node for an edge, ie, it is self connecting.
    - Like for example, a web page can have a link to itself.
    
    - There can be multi edge nodes, for example a Flight Ticketing System.
    - In a simple Directed graph (i.e. No Self Loops or Multi-edges)
    - One can have a maximum of N ( N - 1 ) Edges.
    - Similarly for Undirected Graph, one can have maximum of only N ( N - 1) / 2 Edges.
    - A Graph is called DENSE if number of edges is close to max possible edges, opposit is called SPARSE.
    - We store a Dense graph in "Adjacency Matrix" and for Sparse we use "Adjacency List".
    
# Graph Terminologies >>>
    
    - DEGREE : 
    
        Degree of a node is the number of Adjacent / Connected Nodes to it. Node with 0 degree is an ISOLATED Node.
    
    - PATH : 
    
        - Path is way from One Node to another which consists of Edges connecting one after the other from starting node to another node.
        - A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an Edge.
        - A SIMPLE PATH is one in which no VERTICES or EDGES are repeated. {A , B, F, H}
        
        Types Of PATH : 
            --> Closed Path when you come back to the starting Node, ie, STARTING NODE = DESTINATION NODE
            --> SIMPLE PATH : Is a path which goes through all Distinct nodes, ie, none of the nodes in the way are repeated. But, the starting node can be equal to destination node. 
        
    - WALK : 
    
        When VERTICS and EDGES are repeated, i.e. a PATH is a walk with no repeated EDGES and NODES.
        
    - TRAIL :
    
        A walk is a TRAIL if vertices can be repeated but EDGES can't be repeated.

    - STRONGLY CONNETED GRAPH :
    
        When there exists a PATH between any of the two VERTEX. Keep in mind for DIRECTED GRAPH there might be a path between A and B but not from B to A, and hence don't confuse that one with DIRECTED GRAPH.
          
    - CYCLE IN A GRAPH :
    
        A walk is closed walk if it starts and ends at same vertex.
        Its not a cycle really, A cycle is a term used for Simple cycle where no other vertex except Start/End vertex is repeated.
        
    - ACYCLIC GRAPH (AG): 
    
        A Graph with no cycle is called Acyclic Graph.
        
        - Directed AG {DAG}
        - Undirect AG 
        
    - COMPLETE GRAPH / CLIQUE / UNIVERSAL GRAPH
    
        A simple graph in which there is an edge between every pair of NODES.

    - NULL Graph
        A graph without edge is NULL GRAPH.
        
    - SUB GRAPH 
        A graph G' = (toalNumberOfVertices', E')
        If toalNumberOfVertices' is a subset of toalNumberOfVertices and E' is a subset of E thus all vertices of G' must be in G.
        
    - DIRECTED GRAPH : 

        Directed graph consists of Arcs. This means that from One Node to another there is a directed edge / arc which is UNIDIRECTIONAL.

    - UNDIRECTED GRAPH :

    - MULTI-GRAPH :

        If there are multiple edges connecting the same nodes and there are loops in the Graph.

# A Tree is a graph without any CYCLE. There is a simple path between any two nodes. If T is finite tree with m nodes then T will have m-1 edges. This will be a Labelled graph.


# Problems in Graph Processing Problems

    Path : Is there a path betweeen s and t ?
    Shorted Path : What is the shortest path between s and t?

    Cycle : is there a cycle in the graph?
    Euler Tour : Is there a cycle that uses each EDGE exactly once ?
    Hamilton Tour : Is there a cycle that uses each VERTEX exactly once ?

    Connectivity : is there a way to connect all the vertices ?
    MST : best way to do the above task ?
    BioConnectivity : is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?

    Planarity : Can we draw a graph in the plane with no crossing edges?
    Graph Isomorphism : Two adjacency list represent the same graph?

    Which of these problems are easy? difficult? intractable?

        
# Graph Representation In Memory :

    * IDEA 1 : 
        
        - The simplest IDEA is Two create Two list, one to store the Verticies and other to store Edges Objects.
        
        -  An Edge Object contains the reference to Start and End Vertices it is connecting to, for undirected Graph the order of the edges need not be stored,
           but for Directed Graph the edges direction needs to be stored too.
           Direction is stored by assigning the correct Start and End vertex for an EDGE object.
           Again, for Undirected graph START and END vertex can be swapped, and it won't change the meaning.
        
        - For WEIGHTED GRAPH, we just need to add one more field to the EDGE Object i.e. the Weight of that edge.

    # IDEA 2 :

        - Make Adjacency Matrix of (toalNumberOfVertices X toalNumberOfVertices), For each node which has adjacent vertice is assigned true / 1 or false / 0.
        - For large Graphs, this approach fails as N^2 complexity for large data is crazy thing to have.

    # IDEA 3 :

        {

            Prerequisite : BAG Data Structure

            Imagine a black bag into which you put in items, and after inserting everything you want to retrive items,
            here, you don't really care the order in which the items come out.

            Code :

                Bag Has 2 Operations :

                    Insert()

                        // Insert the items in the Linked List Or In some data structure for Fast Retrival and Insertion

                    Draw()

                        // Get a random number and retrive the element
        }

       Back to Idea 3 :

        - Here you have Adjacency List, which is list of all nodes, and each node points to the Linked List / BAG data structure,
        which consists of all the adjacent nodes to that Node.

        - This is most suitable way to go about Storing graphs in memory

        - Real world Graphs are more SPARSE (high number of vertex, small average degree)
